#Intent-Based Responsive Chatbot
#Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an intent-based responsive chatbot that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries effectively. The chatbot can identify user intents, extract relevant entities, maintain conversation context, and generate appropriate responses. It supports continuous learning through user feedback and can be integrated across multiple platforms.

#Key Features
Intent Recognition: Uses machine learning models to classify the intent behind user messages.

Entity Recognition: Extracts specific pieces of information from user inputs.

Context Management: Maintains conversation state across multiple turns for coherent interactions.

Response Generation: Crafts contextually appropriate responses using rule-based or machine learning models.

Continuous Learning: Improves over time by incorporating user feedback into retraining processes.

Multichannel Support: Interacts with users on various platforms such as web, mobile, and messaging apps.

#Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python

NLP Framework: SpaCy, NLTK, or Transformers

Machine Learning Models: BERT, RNN, or custom-trained models

API Integration: RESTful API for backend communication

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services like AWS or Azure
